# Trial_USCrimeReport
My first repo to be uploaded on GitHub. A tiral one to test out the features and learn the basics and how to work over here. 
Contains analysis of crimes in the US. It is a very simple report with no complex calculations or algorithms used.
I look at some of the highest populated jurisdictions in the US.
I also find out the jurisdictions with the highest rate of homicide in the country.
I draw conclusions from my findings and report them in the project.
